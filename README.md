## Facts
- Some cats have heterochromia! These are cats with two-colored eyes. There are two types of heterochromia: full and partial. **Full heterochromia** is when one eye is blue and the other eye is a completely different color, while **partical heterochromia** is when an eye is a mix of blue and another color. These cats are also known as _odd-eye_ cats. The other eye can be yellow, brown, or green.
